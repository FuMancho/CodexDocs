This guide is for ChatGPT Enterprise admins who want to set up Codex for their workspace.
Use this page as the step-by-step rollout guide. It focuses on setup order and decision points. For detailed policy, configuration, and monitoring details, use the linked pages:
Authentication
,
Security
,
Managed configuration
, and
Governance
.
Enterprise-grade security and privacy
Codex supports ChatGPT Enterprise security features, including:
No training on enterprise data
Zero data retention for the App, CLI, and IDE (code remains in developer environment)
Residency and retention that follow ChatGPT Enterprise policies
Granular user access controls
Data encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
For security controls and runtime protections, see
Security
. Refer to
Zero Data Retention (ZDR)
for more details.
Local vs. cloud setup
Codex operates in two environments: local and cloud.
Codex local
includes the Codex app, CLI, and IDE extension. The agent runs on the developer’s computer in a sandbox.
Codex cloud
includes hosted Codex features (including Codex cloud, iOS, Code Review, and tasks created by the
Slack integration
or
Linear integration
). The agent runs remotely in a hosted container with your codebase.
You can enable local, cloud, or both, and control access with workspace settings and role-based access control (RBAC).
Step 0: Owners and rollout decision
Ensure you have the following owners:
Workspace owner with access to ChatGPT Enterprise
IT management owner for managed configuration
Governance owner for analytics / compliance review
A rollout decision:
Codex local only (Codex app, CLI, and IDE extension)
Codex cloud only (Codex web, GitHub code review)
Both local + cloud
Review
authentication
before rollout:
Codex local supports ChatGPT sign-in or API keys. Confirm MFA/SSO requirements and any managed login restrictions in authentication
Codex cloud requires ChatGPT sign-in
Step 1: Enable workspace toggles
Turn on only the Codex features you plan to roll out in this phase.
Go to
Workspace Settings > Settings and Permissions
.
Codex local
Turn on
Allow members to use Codex Local
.
This enables use of the Codex app, CLI, and IDE extension for allowed users.
If this toggle is off, users who attempt to use the Codex app, CLI, or IDE will see the following error: “403 - Unauthorized. Contact your ChatGPT administrator for access.”
Enable device code authentication for Codex CLI
Allow developers to sign in with device codes when using Codex CLI in a non-interactive environment. More details in
authentication
.
Codex cloud
Prerequisites
Codex cloud requires
GitHub (cloud-hosted) repositories
. If your codebase is on-premises or not on GitHub, you can use the Codex SDK to build similar workflows on your own infrastructure.
To set up Codex as an admin, you must have GitHub access to the repositories
commonly used across your organization. If you don’t have the necessary
access, work with someone on your engineering team who does.
Enable Codex cloud in workspace settings
Start by turning on the ChatGPT GitHub Connector in the Codex section of
Workspace Settings > Settings and Permissions
.
To enable Codex cloud for your workspace, turn on
Allow members to use Codex cloud
. Once enabled, users can access Codex directly from the left-hand navigation panel in ChatGPT.
Note that it may take up to 10 minutes for Codex to appear in ChatGPT.
Allow members to administer Codex
Allows users to view overall Codex
workspace analytics
, access
cloud-managed requirements
, and manage Cloud environments (edit and delete).
Codex cloud not required.
Enable Codex Slack app to post answers on task completion
Codex posts its full answer back to Slack when the task completes. Otherwise, Codex posts only a link to the task.
To learn more, see
Codex in Slack
.
Enable Codex agent to access the internet
By default, Codex cloud agents have no internet access during runtime to help protect against security and safety risks like prompt injection.
This setting enables users to use an allowlist for common software dependency domains, add more domains and trusted sites, and specify allowed HTTP methods.
For security implications of internet access and runtime controls, see
Security
.
Step 2: Set up custom roles (RBAC)
Use RBAC to control which users or groups can access Codex local and Codex cloud.
What RBAC lets you do
Workspace Owners can use RBAC in ChatGPT admin settings to:
Set a default role for users who are not assigned any custom role
Create custom roles with granular permissions
Assign one or more custom roles to Groups (including SCIM-synced groups)
Manage roles centrally from the Custom Roles tab
Users can inherit multiple roles, and permissions resolve to the maximum allowed across those roles.
Important behavior to plan for
Users in any custom role group do not use the workspace default permissions.
If you are gradually rolling out Codex, one suggestion is to have a “Codex Users” group and a second “Codex Admin” group that has the “Allow members to administer Codex” toggle enabled.
For RBAC setup details and the full permission model, see the
OpenAI RBAC Help Center article
.
Step 3: Configure Codex local managed settings
For Codex local, set an admin-approved baseline for local behavior before broader rollout.
Use managed configuration for two different goals
Requirements
(
requirements.toml
): Admin-enforced constraints users cannot override
Managed defaults
(
managed_config.toml
): Starting values applied when Codex launches
Team Config
Teams who want to standardize Codex across an organization can use Team Config to share defaults, rules, and skills without duplicating setup on every local configuration.
Type
Path
Use it to
Config basics
config.toml
Set defaults for sandbox mode, approvals, model, reasoning effort, and more.
Rules
rules/
Control which commands Codex can run outside the sandbox.
Skills
skills/
Make shared skills available to your team.
For locations and precedence, see
Config basics
.
Recommended first decisions for local rollout
Define a baseline for your pilot:
Approval policy posture
Sandbox mode posture
Web search posture
MCP / connectors policy
Local logging and telemetry posture
For exact keys, precedence, MDM deployment, and examples, see
Managed configuration
and
Security
.
If you plan to restrict login method or workspace for local clients, see the admin-managed authentication restrictions in
Authentication
.
Step 4: Configure Codex cloud usage (if enabled)
This step covers repository and environment setup after the Codex cloud workspace toggle is enabled.
Connect Codex cloud to repositories
Navigate to
Codex
and select
Get started
Select
Connect to GitHub
to install the ChatGPT GitHub Connector if you haven’t already connected GitHub to ChatGPT
Install or authorize the ChatGPT GitHub Connector
Choose an installation target for the ChatGPT Connector (typically your main organization)
Allow the repositories you want to connect to Codex
For more, see
Cloud environments
.
Codex uses short-lived, least-privilege GitHub App installation tokens for each operation and respects the user’s existing GitHub repository permissions and branch protection rules.
Configure IP addresses (as needed)
Configure connector / IP allow lists if required by your network policy with these
egress IP ranges
.
These IP ranges can change. Consider checking them automatically and updating your allow list based on the latest values.
Enable code review with Codex cloud
To allow Codex to perform code reviews on GitHub, go to
Settings → Code review
.
Code review can be configured at the repository level. Users can also enable auto review for their PRs and choose when Codex automatically triggers a review. More details on
GitHub
integration page.
Additional integration docs for
Slack
,
GitHub
, and
Linear
.
Step 5: Set up governance and observability
Codex gives enterprise teams several options for visibility into adoption and impact. Set up governance early so your team can monitor adoption, investigate issues, and support compliance workflows.
Codex governance typically uses
Analytics Dashboard for quick, self-serve visibility
Analytics API for programmatic reporting and BI integration
Compliance API for audit and investigation workflows
Recommended minimum setup
Assign an owner for adoption reporting
Assign an owner for audit and compliance review
Define a review cadence
Decide what success looks like
For details and examples, see
Governance
.
Step 6: Confirm and validate setup
What to verify
Users can sign in to Codex local (ChatGPT or API key)
(If enabled) Users can sign in to Codex cloud (ChatGPT sign-in required)
MFA and SSO requirements match your enterprise security policy
RBAC and workspace toggles produce the expected access behavior
Managed configuration is applied for users
Governance data is visible for admins
For authentication options and enterprise login restrictions, see
Authentication
.
Once your team is confident with setup, you can confidently roll Codex out to additional teams and organizations.
