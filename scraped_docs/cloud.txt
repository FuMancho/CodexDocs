API Dashboard
Codex is OpenAI’s coding agent that can read, edit, and run code. It helps you build faster, fix bugs, and understand unfamiliar code. With Codex cloud, Codex can work on tasks in the background (including in parallel) using its own cloud environment.
Codex web setup
Go to
Codex
and connect your GitHub account. This lets Codex work with the code in your repositories and create pull requests from its work.
Your Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, or Enterprise plan includes Codex. Learn more about
what’s included
. Some Enterprise workspaces may require
admin setup
before you can access Codex.
Work with Codex web
Learn about prompting
Write clearer prompts, add constraints, and choose the right level of detail to get better results.
Common workflows
Start with proven patterns for delegating tasks, reviewing changes, and turning results into PRs.
Configuring environments
Choose the repo, setup steps, and tools Codex should use when it runs tasks in the cloud.
Delegate work from the IDE extension
Kick off a cloud task from your editor, then monitor progress and apply the resulting diffs locally.
Delegating from GitHub
Tag
@codex
on issues and pull requests to spin up tasks and propose changes directly from GitHub.
Control internet access
Decide whether Codex can reach the public internet from cloud environments, and when to enable it.
