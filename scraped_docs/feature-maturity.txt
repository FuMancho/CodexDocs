Some Codex features ship behind a maturity label so you can understand how reliable each one is, what might change, and what level of support to expect.
Maturity
What it means
Guidance
Under development
Not ready for use.
Don’t use.
Experimental
Unstable and OpenAI may remove or change it.
Use at your own risk.
Beta
Ready for broad testing; complete in most respects, but some aspects may change based on user feedback.
OK for most evaluation and pilots; expect small changes.
Stable
Fully supported, documented, and ready for broad use; behavior and configuration remain consistent over time.
Safe for production use; removals typically go through a deprecation process.
