Use Codex to review pull requests without leaving GitHub. Add a pull request comment with
@codex review
, and Codex replies with a standard GitHub code review.
Set up code review
Set up
Codex cloud
.
Go to
Codex settings
and turn on
Code review
for your repository.
Request a review
In a pull request comment, mention
@codex review
.
Wait for Codex to react (👀) and post a review.
Codex posts a review on the pull request, just like a teammate would.
Enable automatic reviews
If you want Codex to review every pull request automatically, turn on
Automatic reviews
in
Codex settings
. Codex will post a review whenever a new PR is opened for review, without needing an
@codex review
comment.
Customize what Codex reviews
Codex searches your repository for
AGENTS.md
files and follows any
Review guidelines
you include.
To set guidelines for a repository, add or update a top-level
AGENTS.md
with a section like this:
## Review guidelines
-
Don't log PII.
-
Verify that authentication middleware wraps every route.
Codex applies guidance from the closest
AGENTS.md
to each changed file. You can place more specific instructions deeper in the tree when particular packages need extra scrutiny.
For a one-off focus, add it to your pull request comment, for example:
@codex review for security regressions
In GitHub, Codex flags only P0 and P1 issues. If you want Codex to flag typos in documentation, add guidance in
AGENTS.md
(for example, “Treat typos in docs as P1.”).
Give Codex other tasks
If you mention
@codex
in a comment with anything other than
review
, Codex starts a
cloud task
using your pull request as context.
