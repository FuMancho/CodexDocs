API Dashboard
Governance and Observability
Codex gives enterprise teams visibility into adoption and impact, plus the auditability needed for security and compliance programs. Use the self-serve dashboard for day-to-day tracking, the Analytics API for programmatic reporting, and the Compliance API to export detailed logs into your governance stack.
Ways to track Codex usage
There are three ways to monitor Codex usage, depending on what you need:
Analytics Dashboard
: quick visibility into adoption and code review impact.
Analytics API
: pull structured daily metrics into your data warehouse or BI tools.
Compliance API
: exports detailed activity logs for audit, monitoring, and investigations.
Analytics Dashboard
Dashboards
The
analytics dashboard
allows ChatGPT workspace administrators to track feature adoption.
Codex provides the following dashboards:
Daily users by product (CLI, IDE, cloud, Code Review)
Daily code review users
Daily code reviews
Code reviews by priority level
Daily code reviews by feedback sentiment
Daily cloud tasks
Daily cloud users
Daily VS Code extension users
Daily CLI users
Data export
Administrators can also export Codex analytics data in CSV or JSON format. Codex provides the following export options:
Code review users and reviews (Daily unique users and total reviews completed in Code Review)
Code review findings and feedback (Daily counts of comments, reactions, replies, and priority-level findings)
cloud users and tasks (daily unique cloud users and tasks completed)
CLI and VS Code users (Daily unique users for the Codex CLI and VS Code extension)
Sessions and messages per user (Daily session starts and user message counts for each Codex user across surfaces)
Analytics API
Use the
Analytics API
when you want to automate reporting, build internal dashboards, or join Codex metrics with your existing engineering data.
What it measures
The Analytics API provides daily, time-series metrics for a workspace, with optional per-user breakdowns and per-client usage.
Endpoints
Daily usage and adoption
Daily totals for threads, turns, and credits
Breakdown by client surface
Optional per-user reporting for adoption and power-user analysis
Code review activity
Pull request reviews completed by Codex
Total comments generated by Codex
Severity breakdown of comments
User engagement with code review
Replies to Codex comments
Reactions, including upvotes and downvotes
Engagement breakdowns for how teams respond to Codex feedback
How it works
Analytics is daily and time-windowed. Results are time-ordered and returned in pages with cursor-based pagination. You can query by workspace and optionally group by user or aggregate at the workspace level.
Common use cases
Engineering observability dashboards
Adoption reporting for leadership updates
Usage governance and cost monitoring
Compliance API
Use the
Compliance API
when you need auditable records for security, legal, and governance workflows.
What it measures
The Compliance API gives enterprises a way to export logs and metadata for Codex activity so you can connect that data to your existing audit, monitoring, and security workflows. It is designed for use with tools like eDiscovery, DLP, SIEM, or other compliance systems.
For Codex usage authenticated through ChatGPT, Compliance API exports provide audit records for Codex activity and can be used in investigations and compliance workflows. These audit logs are retained for up to 30 days. API-key-authenticated Codex usage follows your API organization settings and is not included in Compliance API exports.
What you can export
Activity logs
Prompt text sent to Codex
Responses Codex generated
Identifiers such as workspace, user, timestamp, and model
Token usage and related request metadata
Metadata for audit and investigation
Use record metadata to answer questions like:
Who ran a task
When it ran
Which model was used
How much content was processed
Common use cases
Security investigations
Compliance reporting
Policy enforcement audits
Routing events into SIEM and eDiscovery pipelines
What it does not provide
Lines of code generated (a bit of a noisy proxy for productivity and can incentivize the wrong behavior)
Acceptance rate of suggestions (almost 100% since users usually accept the change first)
Code quality or performance KPIs
Recommended pattern
Most enterprises use a combination of:
Analytics Dashboard
for self-serve monitoring and quick answers
Analytics API
for automated reporting and BI integration
Compliance API
for audit exports and investigations
