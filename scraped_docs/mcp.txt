API Dashboard
Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects models to tools and context. Use it to give Codex access to third-party documentation, or to let it interact with developer tools like your browser or Figma.
Codex supports MCP servers in both the CLI and the IDE extension.
Supported MCP features
STDIO servers
: Servers that run as a local process (started by a command).
Environment variables
Streamable HTTP servers
: Servers that you access at an address.
Bearer token authentication
OAuth authentication (run
codex mcp login <server-name>
for servers that support OAuth)
Connect Codex to an MCP server
Codex stores MCP configuration in
config.toml
alongside other Codex configuration settings. By default this is
~/.codex/config.toml
, but you can also scope MCP servers to a project with
.codex/config.toml
(trusted projects only).
The CLI and the IDE extension share this configuration. Once you configure your MCP servers, you can switch between the two Codex clients without redoing setup.
To configure MCP servers, choose one option:
Use the CLI
: Run
codex mcp
to add and manage servers.
Edit
config.toml
: Update
~/.codex/config.toml
(or a project-scoped
.codex/config.toml
in trusted projects) directly.
Configure with the CLI
Add an MCP server
codex
mcp
add
<
server-nam
e
>
--env
VAR1=VALUE1
--env
VAR2=VALUE2
--
<
stdio
server-comman
d
>
For example, to add Context7 (a free MCP server for developer documentation), you can run the following command:
codex
mcp
add
context7
--
npx
-y
@upstash/context7-mcp
Other CLI commands
To see all available MCP commands, you can run
codex mcp --help
.
Terminal UI (TUI)
In the
codex
TUI, use
/mcp
to see your active MCP servers.
Configure with config.toml
For more fine-grained control over MCP server options, edit
~/.codex/config.toml
(or a project-scoped
.codex/config.toml
). In the IDE extension, select
MCP settings
>
Open config.toml
from the gear menu.
Configure each MCP server with a
[mcp_servers.<server-name>]
table in the configuration file.
STDIO servers
command
(required): The command that starts the server.
args
(optional): Arguments to pass to the server.
env
(optional): Environment variables to set for the server.
env_vars
(optional): Environment variables to allow and forward.
cwd
(optional): Working directory to start the server from.
Streamable HTTP servers
url
(required): The server address.
bearer_token_env_var
(optional): Environment variable name for a bearer token to send in
Authorization
.
http_headers
(optional): Map of header names to static values.
env_http_headers
(optional): Map of header names to environment variable names (values pulled from the environment).
Other configuration options
startup_timeout_sec
(optional): Timeout (seconds) for the server to start. Default:
10
.
tool_timeout_sec
(optional): Timeout (seconds) for the server to run a tool. Default:
60
.
enabled
(optional): Set
false
to disable a server without deleting it.
required
(optional): Set
true
to make startup fail if this enabled server can’t initialize.
enabled_tools
(optional): Tool allow list.
disabled_tools
(optional): Tool deny list (applied after
enabled_tools
).
If your OAuth provider requires a fixed callback port, set the top-level
mcp_oauth_callback_port
in
config.toml
. If unset, Codex binds to an ephemeral port.
If your MCP OAuth flow must use a specific callback URL (for example, a remote devbox ingress URL or a custom callback path), set
mcp_oauth_callback_url
. Codex uses this value as the OAuth
redirect_uri
while still using
mcp_oauth_callback_port
for the callback listener port. Local callback URLs (for example
localhost
) bind on loopback; non-local callback URLs bind on
0.0.0.0
so the callback can reach the host.

Examples of useful MCP servers
The list of MCP servers keeps growing. Here are a few common ones:
OpenAI Docs MCP
: Search and read OpenAI developer docs.
Context7
: Connect to up-to-date developer documentation.
Figma
Local
and
Remote
: Access your Figma designs.
Playwright
: Control and inspect a browser using Playwright.
Chrome Developer Tools
: Control and inspect Chrome.
Sentry
: Access Sentry logs.
GitHub
: Manage GitHub beyond what
git
supports (for example, pull requests and issues).
