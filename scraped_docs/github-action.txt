API Dashboard
Use the Codex GitHub Action (
openai/codex-action@v1
) to run Codex in CI/CD jobs, apply patches, or post reviews from a GitHub Actions workflow.
The action installs the Codex CLI, starts the Responses API proxy when you provide an API key, and runs
codex exec
under the permissions you specify.
Reach for the action when you want to:
Automate Codex feedback on pull requests or releases without managing the CLI yourself.
Gate changes on Codex-driven quality checks as part of your CI pipeline.
Run repeatable Codex tasks (code review, release prep, migrations) from a workflow file.
For a CI example, see
Non-interactive mode
and explore the source in the
openai/codex-action repository
.
Prerequisites
Store your OpenAI key as a GitHub secret (for example
OPENAI_API_KEY
) and reference it in the workflow.
Run the job on a Linux or macOS runner. For Windows, set
safety-strategy: unsafe
.
Check out your code before invoking the action so Codex can read the repository contents.
Decide which prompts you want to run. You can provide inline text via
prompt
or point to a file committed in the repo with
prompt-file
.
Example workflow
The sample workflow below reviews new pull requests, captures Codex’s response, and posts it back on the PR.

:

Replace
.github/codex/prompts/review.md
with your own prompt file or use the
prompt
input for inline text. The example also writes the final Codex message to
codex-output.md
for later inspection or artifact upload.
Configure
codex exec
Fine-tune how Codex runs by setting the action inputs that map to
codex exec
options:
prompt
or
prompt-file
(choose one): Inline instructions or a repository path to Markdown or text with your task. Consider storing prompts in
.github/codex/prompts/
.
codex-args
: Extra CLI flags. Provide a JSON array (for example
["--full-auto"]
) or a shell string (
--full-auto --sandbox danger-full-access
) to allow edits, streaming, or MCP configuration.
model
and
effort
: Pick the Codex agent configuration you want; leave empty for defaults.
sandbox
: Match the sandbox mode (
workspace-write
,
read-only
,
danger-full-access
) to the permissions Codex needs during the run.
output-file
: Save the final Codex message to disk so later steps can upload or diff it.
codex-version
: Pin a specific CLI release. Leave blank to use the latest published version.
codex-home
: Point to a shared Codex home directory if you want to reuse configuration files or MCP setups across steps.
Manage privileges
Codex has broad access on GitHub-hosted runners unless you restrict it. Use these inputs to control exposure:
safety-strategy
(default
drop-sudo
) removes
sudo
before running Codex. This is irreversible for the job and protects secrets in memory. On Windows you must set
safety-strategy: unsafe
.
unprivileged-user
pairs
safety-strategy: unprivileged-user
with
codex-user
to run Codex as a specific account. Ensure the user can read and write the repository checkout (see
.cache/codex-action/examples/unprivileged-user.yml
for an ownership fix).
read-only
keeps Codex from changing files or using the network, but it still runs with elevated privileges. Don’t rely on
read-only
alone to protect secrets.
sandbox
limits filesystem and network access within Codex itself. Choose the narrowest option that still lets the task complete.
allow-users
and
allow-bots
restrict who can trigger the workflow. By default only users with write access can run the action; list extra trusted accounts explicitly or leave the field empty for the default behavior.
Capture outputs
The action emits the last Codex message through the
final-message
output. Map it to a job output (as shown above) or handle it directly in later steps. Combine
output-file
with the uploaded artifacts feature if you prefer to collect the full transcript from the runner. When you need structured data, pass
--output-schema
through
codex-args
to enforce a JSON shape.
Security checklist
Limit who can start the workflow. Prefer trusted events or explicit approvals instead of allowing everyone to run Codex against your repository.
Sanitize prompt inputs from pull requests, commit messages, or issue bodies to avoid prompt injection. Review HTML comments or hidden text before feeding it to Codex.
Protect your
OPENAI_API_KEY
by keeping
safety-strategy
on
drop-sudo
or moving Codex to an unprivileged user. Never leave the action in
unsafe
mode on multi-tenant runners.
Run Codex as the last step in a job so later steps don’t inherit any unexpected state changes.
Rotate keys immediately if you suspect the proxy logs or action output exposed secret material.
Troubleshooting
You set both prompt and prompt-file
: Remove the duplicate input so you provide exactly one source.
responses-api-proxy didn’t write server info
: Confirm the API key is present and valid; the proxy starts only when you provide
openai-api-key
.
Expected
sudo
removal, but
sudo
succeeded
: Ensure no earlier step restored
sudo
and that the runner OS is Linux or macOS. Re-run with a fresh job.
Permission errors after
drop-sudo
: Grant write access before the action runs (for example with
chmod -R g+rwX "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE"
or by using the unprivileged-user pattern).
Unauthorized trigger blocked
: Adjust
allow-users
or
allow-bots
inputs if you need to permit service accounts beyond the default write collaborators.
