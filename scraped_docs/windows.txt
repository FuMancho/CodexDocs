The easiest way to use Codex on Windows is to
set up the IDE extension
or
install the CLI
and run it from PowerShell.
When you run Codex natively on Windows, agent mode uses a
Windows sandbox
to block filesystem writes outside the working folder and prevent network access without your explicit approval.
Learn more below
.
If you prefer to have Codex use
Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL2),
read the instructions
below.
Windows sandbox
Native Windows sandbox support includes two modes that you can configure in
config.toml
:
[
windows
]
sandbox =
"unelevated"
# or "elevated"
How
elevated
mode works:
Uses a Restricted Token approach with filesystem ACLs to limit which files the sandbox can write to.
Runs commands as a dedicated Windows Sandbox User.
Limits network access by installing Windows Firewall rules.
Grant sandbox read access
When a command fails because the Windows sandbox can’t read a directory, use:
/sandbox-add-read-dir C:\absolute\directory\path
The path must be an existing absolute directory. After the command succeeds, later commands that run in the sandbox can read that directory during the current session.
Windows Subsystem for Linux
Launch VS Code from inside WSL
For step-by-step instructions, see the
official VS Code WSL tutorial
.
Prerequisites
Windows with WSL installed. To install WSL, open PowerShell as an administrator, then run
wsl --install
(Ubuntu is a common choice).
VS Code with the
WSL extension
installed.
Open VS Code from a WSL terminal
# From your WSL shell
cd
~/code/your-project
code
.
This opens a WSL remote window, installs the VS Code Server if needed, and ensures integrated terminals run in Linux.
Confirm you’re connected to WSL
Look for the green status bar that shows
WSL: <distro>
.
Integrated terminals should display Linux paths (such as
/home/...
) instead of
C:\
.
You can verify with:
echo
$WSL_DISTRO_NAME
This prints your distribution name.
If you don’t see “WSL: …” in the status bar, press
Ctrl+Shift+P
, pick
WSL: Reopen Folder in WSL
, and keep your repository under
/home/...
(not
C:\
) for best performance.
Use Codex CLI with WSL
Run these commands from an elevated PowerShell or Windows Terminal:
# Install default Linux distribution (like Ubuntu)
wsl
--
install
# Start a shell inside Windows Subsystem for Linux
wsl
Then run these commands from your WSL shell:
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl
# Install Node.js in WSL (via nvm)
curl
-o-
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh
|
bash
# In a new tab or after exiting and running `wsl` again to install Node.js
nvm
install
22
# Install and run Codex in WSL
npm
i
-g
@openai/codex
codex
Working on code inside WSL
Working in Windows-mounted paths like
/mnt/c/…
can be slower than working in Windows-native paths. Keep your repositories under your Linux home directory (like
~/code/my-app
) for faster I/O and fewer symlink and permission issues:
mkdir
-p
~/code
&&
cd
~/code
git
clone
https://github.com/your/repo.git
cd
repo
If you need Windows access to files, they’re under
\wsl$\Ubuntu\home&lt;user>
in Explorer.
Troubleshooting and FAQ
Installed extension, but it’s unresponsive
Your system may be missing C++ development tools, which some native dependencies require:
Visual Studio Build Tools (C++ workload)
Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)
With
winget
, run
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools -e
Then fully restart VS Code after installation.
If it feels slow on large repositories
Make sure you’re not working under
/mnt/c
. Move the repository to WSL (for example,
~/code/…
).
Increase memory and CPU for WSL if needed; update WSL to the latest version:
wsl
--
update
wsl
--
shutdown
VS Code in WSL can’t find
codex
Verify the binary exists and is on PATH inside WSL:
which
codex
||
echo
"codex not found"
If the binary isn’t found, install it by
following the instructions
above.
