Use environments to control what Codex installs and runs during cloud tasks. For example, you can add dependencies, install tools like linters and formatters, and set environment variables.
Configure environments in
Codex settings
.
How Codex cloud tasks run
Here’s what happens when you submit a task:
Codex creates a container and checks out your repo at the selected branch or commit SHA.
Codex runs your setup script, plus an optional maintenance script when a cached container is resumed.
Codex applies your internet access settings. Setup scripts run with internet access. Agent internet access is off by default, but you can enable limited or unrestricted access if needed. See
agent internet access
.
The agent runs terminal commands in a loop. It edits code, runs checks, and tries to validate its work. If your repo includes
AGENTS.md
, the agent uses it to find project-specific lint and test commands.
When the agent finishes, it shows its answer and a diff of any files it changed. You can open a PR or ask follow-up questions.
Default universal image
The Codex agent runs in a default container image called
universal
, which comes pre-installed with common languages, packages, and tools.
In environment settings, select
Set package versions
to pin versions of Python, Node.js, and other runtimes.
For details on what’s installed, see
openai/codex-universal
for a
reference Dockerfile and an image that can be pulled and tested locally.
While
codex-universal
comes with languages pre-installed for speed and convenience, you can also install additional packages to the container using
setup scripts
.
Environment variables and secrets
Environment variables
are set for the full duration of the task (including setup scripts and the agent phase).
Secrets
are similar to environment variables, except:
They are stored with an additional layer of encryption and are only decrypted for task execution.
They are only available to setup scripts. For security reasons, secrets are removed before the agent phase starts.
Automatic setup
For projects using common package managers (
npm
,
yarn
,
pnpm
,
pip
,
pipenv
, and
poetry
), Codex can automatically install dependencies and tools.
Manual setup
If your development setup is more complex, you can also provide a custom setup script. For example:
# Install type checker
pip
install
pyright
# Install dependencies
poetry
install
--with
test
pnpm
install
Setup scripts run in a separate Bash session from the agent, so commands like
export
do not persist into the agent phase. To persist environment
variables, add them to
~/.bashrc
or configure them in environment settings.
Container caching
Codex caches container state for up to 12 hours to speed up new tasks and follow-ups.
When an environment is cached:
Codex clones the repository and checks out the default branch.
Codex runs the setup script and caches the resulting container state.
When a cached container is resumed:
Codex checks out the branch specified for the task.
Codex runs the maintenance script (optional). This is useful when the setup script ran on an older commit and dependencies need to be updated.
Codex automatically invalidates the cache if you change the setup script, maintenance script, environment variables, or secrets. If your repo changes in a way that makes the cached state incompatible, select
Reset cache
on the environment page.
For Business and Enterprise users, caches are shared across all users who have
access to the environment. Invalidating the cache will affect all users of the
environment in your workspace.
Internet access and network proxy
Internet access is available during the setup script phase to install dependencies. During the agent phase, internet access is off by default, but you can configure limited or unrestricted access. See
agent internet access
.
Environments run behind an HTTP/HTTPS network proxy for security and abuse prevention purposes. All outbound internet traffic passes through this proxy.
