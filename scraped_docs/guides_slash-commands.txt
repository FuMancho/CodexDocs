Slash commands give you fast, keyboard-first control over Codex. Type
/
in the composer to open the slash popup, choose a command, and Codex will perform actions such as switching models, adjusting permissions, or summarizing long conversations without leaving the terminal.
This guide shows you how to:
Find the right built-in slash command for a task
Steer an active session with commands like
/model
,
/personality
,
/permissions
,
/experimental
,
/agent
, and
/status
Built-in slash commands
Codex ships with the following commands. Open the slash popup and start typing the command name to filter the list.
Command
Purpose
When to use it
/permissions
Set what Codex can do without asking first.
Relax or tighten approval requirements mid-session, such as switching between Auto and Read Only.
/sandbox-add-read-dir
Grant sandbox read access to an extra directory (Windows only).
Unblock commands that need to read an absolute directory path outside the current readable roots.
/agent
Switch the active agent thread.
Inspect or continue work in a spawned sub-agent thread.
/apps
Browse apps (connectors) and insert them into your prompt.
Attach an app as
$app-slug
before asking Codex to use it.
/compact
Summarize the visible conversation to free tokens.
Use after long runs so Codex retains key points without blowing the context window.
/diff
Show the Git diff, including files Git isn’t tracking yet.
Review Codex’s edits before you commit or run tests.
/exit
Exit the CLI (same as
/quit
).
Alternative spelling; both commands exit the session.
/experimental
Toggle experimental features.
Enable optional features such as sub-agents from the CLI.
/feedback
Send logs to the Codex maintainers.
Report issues or share diagnostics with support.
/init
Generate an
AGENTS.md
scaffold in the current directory.
Capture persistent instructions for the repository or subdirectory you’re working in.
/logout
Sign out of Codex.
Clear local credentials when using a shared machine.
/mcp
List configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.
Check which external tools Codex can call during the session.
/mention
Attach a file to the conversation.
Point Codex at specific files or folders you want it to inspect next.
/model
Choose the active model (and reasoning effort, when available).
Switch between general-purpose models (
gpt-4.1-mini
) and deeper reasoning models before running a task.
/plan
Switch to plan mode and optionally send a prompt.
Ask Codex to propose an execution plan before implementation work starts.
/personality
Choose a communication style for responses.
Make Codex more concise, more explanatory, or more collaborative without changing your instructions.
/ps
Show experimental background terminals and their recent output.
Check long-running commands without leaving the main transcript.
/fork
Fork the current conversation into a new thread.
Branch the active session to explore a new approach without losing the current transcript.
/resume
Resume a saved conversation from your session list.
Continue work from a previous CLI session without starting over.
/new
Start a new conversation inside the same CLI session.
Reset the chat context without leaving the CLI when you want a fresh prompt in the same repo.
/quit
Exit the CLI.
Leave the session immediately.
/review
Ask Codex to review your working tree.
Run after Codex completes work or when you want a second set of eyes on local changes.
/status
Display session configuration and token usage.
Confirm the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and remaining context capacity.
/debug-config
Print config layer and requirements diagnostics.
Debug precedence and policy requirements, including experimental network constraints.
/statusline
Configure TUI status-line fields interactively.
Pick and reorder footer items (model/context/limits/git/tokens/session) and persist in config.toml.
/quit
and
/exit
both exit the CLI. Use them only after you have saved or committed any important work.
The
/approvals
command still works as an alias, but it no longer appears in the slash popup list.
Control your session with slash commands
The following workflows keep your session on track without restarting Codex.
Set the active model with
/model
Start Codex and open the composer.
Type
/model
and press Enter.
Choose a model such as
gpt-4.1-mini
or
gpt-4.1
from the popup.
Expected: Codex confirms the new model in the transcript. Run
/status
to verify the change.
Set a communication style with
/personality
Use
/personality
to change how Codex communicates without rewriting your prompt.
In an active conversation, type
/personality
and press Enter.
Choose a style from the popup.
Expected: Codex confirms the new style in the transcript and uses it for later responses in the thread.
Codex supports
friendly
,
pragmatic
, and
none
personalities. Use
none
to disable personality instructions.
If the active model doesn’t support personality-specific instructions, Codex hides this command.
Switch to plan mode with
/plan
Type
/plan
and press Enter to switch the active conversation into plan mode.
Optional: provide inline prompt text (for example,
/plan Propose a migration plan for this service
).
You can paste content or attach images while using inline
/plan
arguments.
Expected: Codex enters plan mode and uses your optional inline prompt as the first planning request.
While a task is already running,
/plan
is temporarily unavailable.
Toggle experimental features with
/experimental
Type
/experimental
and press Enter.
Toggle the features you want (for example,
Multi-agents
), then restart Codex.
Expected: Codex saves your feature choices to config and applies them on restart.
Update permissions with
/permissions
Type
/permissions
and press Enter.
Select the approval preset that matches your comfort level, for example
Auto
for hands-off runs or
Read Only
to review edits.
Expected: Codex announces the updated policy. Future actions respect the new approval mode until you change it again.
Grant sandbox read access with
/sandbox-add-read-dir
This command is available only when running the CLI natively on Windows.
Type
/sandbox-add-read-dir C:\absolute\directory\path
and press Enter.
Confirm the path is an existing absolute directory.
Expected: Codex refreshes the Windows sandbox policy and grants read access to that directory for later commands that run in the sandbox.
Inspect the session with
/status
In any conversation, type
/status
.
Review the output for the active model, approval policy, writable roots, and current token usage.
Expected: You see a summary like what
codex status
prints in the shell, confirming Codex is operating where you expect.
Inspect config layers with
/debug-config
Type
/debug-config
.
Review the output for config layer order (lowest precedence first), on/off state, and policy sources.
Expected: Codex prints layer diagnostics plus policy details such as
allowed_approval_policies
,
allowed_sandbox_modes
,
mcp_servers
,
rules
,
enforce_residency
, and
experimental_network
when configured.
Use this output to debug why an effective setting differs from
config.toml
.
Configure footer items with
/statusline
Type
/statusline
.
Use the picker to toggle and reorder items, then confirm.
Expected: The footer status line updates immediately and persists to
tui.status_line
in
config.toml
.
Available status-line items include model, model+reasoning, context stats, rate limits, git branch, token counters, session id, current directory/project root, and Codex version.
Check background terminals with
/ps
Type
/ps
.
Review the list of background terminals and their status.
Expected: Codex shows each background terminal’s command plus up to three recent, non-empty output lines so you can gauge progress at a glance.
Background terminals appear when
unified_exec
is in use; otherwise, the list may be empty.
Keep transcripts lean with
/compact
After a long exchange, type
/compact
.
Confirm when Codex offers to summarize the conversation so far.
Expected: Codex replaces earlier turns with a concise summary, freeing context while keeping critical details.
Review changes with
/diff
Type
/diff
to inspect the Git diff.
Scroll through the output inside the CLI to review edits and added files.
Expected: Codex shows changes you’ve staged, changes you haven’t staged yet, and files Git hasn’t started tracking, so you can decide what to keep.
Highlight files with
/mention
Type
/mention
followed by a path, for example
/mention src/lib/api.ts
.
Select the matching result from the popup.
Expected: Codex adds the file to the conversation, ensuring follow-up turns reference it directly.
Start a new conversation with
/new
Type
/new
and press Enter.
Expected: Codex starts a fresh conversation in the same CLI session, so you can switch tasks without leaving your terminal.
Resume a saved conversation with
/resume
Type
/resume
and press Enter.
Choose the session you want from the saved-session picker.
Expected: Codex reloads the selected conversation’s transcript so you can pick up where you left off, keeping the original history intact.
Fork the current conversation with
/fork
Type
/fork
and press Enter.
Expected: Codex clones the current conversation into a new thread with a fresh ID, leaving the original transcript untouched so you can explore an alternative approach in parallel.
If you need to fork a saved session instead of the current one, run
codex fork
in your terminal to open the session picker.
Generate
AGENTS.md
with
/init
Run
/init
in the directory where you want Codex to look for persistent instructions.
Review the generated
AGENTS.md
, then edit it to match your repository conventions.
Expected: Codex creates an
AGENTS.md
scaffold you can refine and commit for future sessions.
Ask for a working tree review with
/review
Type
/review
.
Follow up with
/diff
if you want to inspect the exact file changes.
Expected: Codex summarizes issues it finds in your working tree, focusing on behavior changes and missing tests. It uses the current session model unless you set
review_model
in
config.toml
.
List MCP tools with
/mcp
Type
/mcp
.
Review the list to confirm which MCP servers and tools are available.
Expected: You see the configured Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools Codex can call in this session.
Browse apps with
/apps
Type
/apps
.
Pick an app from the list.
Expected: Codex inserts the app mention into the composer as
$app-slug
, so you can immediately ask Codex to use it.
Switch agent threads with
/agent
Type
/agent
and press Enter.
Select the thread you want from the picker.
Expected: Codex switches the active thread so you can inspect or continue that agent’s work.
Send feedback with
/feedback
Type
/feedback
and press Enter.
Follow the prompts to include logs or diagnostics.
Expected: Codex collects the requested diagnostics and submits them to the maintainers.
Sign out with
/logout
Type
/logout
and press Enter.
Expected: Codex clears local credentials for the current user session.
Exit the CLI with
/quit
or
/exit
Type
/quit
(or
/exit
) and press Enter.
Expected: Codex exits immediately. Save or commit any important work first.
