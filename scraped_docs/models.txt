Other models
Codex works best with the models listed above.
You can also point Codex at any model and provider that supports either the
Chat Completions
or
Responses APIs
to fit your specific use case.
Support for the Chat Completions API is deprecated and will be removed in
future releases of Codex.
Configuring models
Configure your default local model
The Codex CLI and IDE extension use the same
config.toml
configuration file
. To specify a model, add a
model
entry to your configuration file. If you don’t specify a model, the Codex app, CLI, or IDE Extension defaults to a recommended model.
model =
"gpt-5.2"
Choosing a different local model temporarily
In the Codex CLI, you can use the
/model
command during an active thread to change the model. In the IDE extension, you can use the model selector below the input box to choose your model.
To start a new Codex CLI thread with a specific model or to specify the model for
codex exec
you can use the
--model
/
-m
flag:
codex
-m
gpt-5.3-codex
Choosing your model for cloud tasks
Currently, you can’t change the default model for Codex cloud tasks.
