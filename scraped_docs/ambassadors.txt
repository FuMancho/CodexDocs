Codex is rapidly becoming one of the most powerful ways to build,
          driven by builders who share real-world workflows and lessons with
          each other.
Codex Ambassadors are community organizers, open-source maintainers,
          student leaders, and power users who actively spread what works, make
          Codex easier to adopt in practice, and help shape where it goes next.
Apply Today
Upcoming Meetups
Ambassadors run hands-on meetups, workshops, and community sessions
          around the world.
What you’ll do
As a Codex Ambassador, you’ll join a small global cohort and partner
            with OpenAI to:
Run hands-on Codex events in your local community
Create reusable learning assets others can build on
Experiment with ideas to grow and support builder communities
Share candid, real-world feedback directly with the Codex team
Who should apply
We’re looking for people with hands-on experience leading or
            supporting developer communities, like running meetups, maintaining
            open-source projects, teaching workshops, or regularly helping
            others learn how to build.
Support from OpenAI
Codex credits to support your own work and power local events
Ready-to-use starter kits you can tailor to your community
A direct line to fellow Ambassadors and the Codex team for
              collaboration and feedback
Invitations to future exclusive events where you can meet the
              Codex team
Exclusive swag and a honorarium for your time and contributions
This is a two-way program, and will also evolve our support based on
            what the cohort learns on the ground.
Time commitment:
~2–4 hours per week
Bring your community with you
If you like bringing people together to build, learn, and share,
              and you're excited to help shape what a great ambassador program
              can be, we'd love to hear from you.
