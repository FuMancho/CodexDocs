API Dashboard
If you use Codex through the Codex CLI, the IDE extension, or Codex Web, you can also control it programmatically.
Use the SDK when you need to:
Control Codex as part of your CI/CD pipeline
Create your own agent that can engage with Codex to perform complex engineering tasks
Build Codex into your own internal tools and workflows
Integrate Codex within your own application
TypeScript library
The TypeScript library provides a way to control Codex from within your application that is more comprehensive and flexible than non-interactive mode.
Use the library server-side; it requires Node.js 18 or later.
Installation
To get started, install the Codex SDK using
npm
:
npm
install
@openai/codex-sdk
Usage
Start a thread with Codex and run it with your prompt.
import
{ Codex }
from
"@openai/codex-sdk"
;
const
codex
=
new
Codex
();
const
thread
=
codex.
startThread
();
const
result
=
await
thread.
run
(
"Make a plan to diagnose and fix the CI failures"
);
console.
log
(result);
Call
run()
again to continue on the same thread, or resume a past thread by providing a thread ID.
// running the same thread
const
result
=
await
thread.
run
(
"Implement the plan"
);
console.
log
(result);
// resuming past thread
const
threadId
=
"<thread-id>"
;
const
thread2
=
codex.
resumeThread
(threadId);
const
result2
=
await
thread2.
run
(
"Pick up where you left off"
);
console.
log
(result2);
