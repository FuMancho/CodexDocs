API Dashboard
Use the settings panel to tune how the Codex app behaves, how it opens files,
and how it connects to tools. Open
Settings
from the app menu or
press
Cmd
+
,
.
General
Choose where files open and how much command output appears in threads. You can also
require
Cmd
+
Enter
for multiline prompts or prevent sleep while a
thread runs.
Appearance
Pick a theme, decide whether the window is solid, and adjust UI or code fonts. Font
choices apply across the app, including the diff review panel and terminal.
Notifications
Choose when turn completion notifications appear, and whether the app should prompt for
notification permissions.
Agent configuration
Codex agents in the app inherit the same configuration as the IDE and CLI extension.
Use the in-app controls for common settings, or edit
config.toml
for advanced
options. See
Codex security
and
config basics
for more detail.
Git
Use Git settings to standardize branch naming and choose whether Codex uses force
pushes.
You can also set prompts that Codex uses to generate commit messages and pull request descriptions.
Integrations & MCP
Connect external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Enable recommended servers or
add your own. If a server requires OAuth, the app starts the auth flow. These settings
also apply to the Codex CLI and IDE extension because the MCP configuration lives in
config.toml
. See the
Model Context Protocol docs
for details.
Personalization
Choose
Friendly
,
Pragmatic
, or
None
as your default personality. Use
None
to disable personality instructions. You can update this at any time.
You can also add your own custom instructions. Editing custom instructions updates your
personal instructions in
AGENTS.md
.
Archived threads
The
Archived threads
section lists archived chats with dates and project
context. Use
Unarchive
to restore a thread.
